# PyFunctional
`PyFunctional` is a small library which is trying to bring a few well-established concepts from functional programing to Python. The package was inspired by libraries like [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [rambdajs](http://ramdajs.com/). The monads section is modeled after [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and influenced heavily by ["Scala with Cats"](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/)
