  - Thanks to b49P23TIvg for suggesting that I should use a set operation
      instead of repeated membership tests.
  - Thanks to Ian Kelly for pointing out that
      - "minArgs = None" is better than "minArgs = -1",
      - "if args" is better than "if len(args)", and
      - I should use "isdisjoint".

  Decorator to curry a function, typical usage:

  >>> @curry
  ... def foo(a, b, c):
  ...    return a + b + c

  The function still work normally:
  >>> foo(1, 2, 3)
  6

  And in various curried forms:
  >>> foo(1)(2, 3)
  6
  >>> foo(1)(2)(3)
  6

  This also work with named arguments:
  >>> foo(a=1)(b=2)(c=3)
  6
  >>> foo(b=1)(c=2)(a=3)
  6
  >>> foo(a=1, b=2)(c=3)
  6
  >>> foo(a=1)(b=2, c=3)
  6

  And you may also change your mind on named arguments,
  But I don't know why you may want to do that:
  >>> foo(a=1, b=0)(b=2, c=3)
  6

  Finally, if you give more parameters than expected, the exception
  is the expected one, not some garbage produced by the currying
  mechanism:

  >>> foo(1, 2)(3, 4)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
  TypeError: foo() takes exactly 3 arguments (4 given)
